### Compatible PocketMine-MP Versions: 3.14.X 
Currently being revived by 95CivicSi - Stay tuned for more updates

#### Feature Locked
As of PureEntitiesX v0.6.9, the stable branch will be feature locked and only receive necessary protocol updates or bug fixes.  New mobs, movement updates, and behavior changes will be made to the v1.0.0 branch until it is ready for release.

#### Stable Versions:
The most reliable versions of PureEntitiesX will be [in the release section](https://github.com/RevivalPMMP/PureEntitiesX/releases/) and then released to [Poggit](https://poggit.pmmp.io/p/PureEntitiesX/).  Released versions will be updated to work with released versions of PocketMine-MP (found here: https://github.com/pmmp/PocketMine-MP/releases).  This means that if you are using the latest build of PocketMine-MP from jenkins.pmmp.io or directly from the PocketMine-MP master branch, then PureEntitiesX may not work as those versions are constantly being changed and updated with new items daily (sometimes multiple times per day).
